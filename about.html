        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Joseph Telaak, and I am currently pursuing a pathway in Research as part of my Graduation with Leadership Distinction (GLD) at the University of South Carolina. I’m majoring in Computer Engineering, and my journey at USC has been defined by a deep engagement in research and technical projects.</p>

        <p>During my time at USC, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of research projects that have significantly shaped my undergraduate experience. As an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the SyReX Lab, I’ve focused on projects that utilize millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology for advanced sensing applications. One of the key projects I've worked on involves developing a system that predicts electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using mmWave radar. This project has allowed me to explore the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and healthcare technology.</p>

        <p>Beyond the SyReX Lab, I've been involved in several other projects at USC. For instance, in the ELCT 201 course, I was part of a team that developed a remote control car with collision detection. We used a Raspberry Pi and LIDAR technology to create a system capable of detecting obstacles and autonomously stopping the car to avoid collisions. This project was a practical application of my coursework and helped me develop strong teamwork and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <p>Another highlight of my time at USC was presenting my work on an Arduino-based rocket flight computer at the AIAA Region II Student Conference. I designed a flight computer that could monitor a model rocket’s flight parameters using GPS, IMU, and telemetry systems. Presenting this work was a valuable experience that underscored the importance of clear communication in engineering.</p>

        <p>These research experiences have been both challenging and rewarding, helping me grow as a student and researcher. Because of my passion for research, I’ve chosen the Research Pathway for my graduation with Leadership Distinction. This pathway reflects my commitment to hands-on learning and my goal to contribute meaningfully to the field of engineering.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, I plan to continue working on research in advanced sensing and signal processing technologies. My portfolio showcases the key insights I’ve gained throughout my time at USC, highlighting how these experiences have shaped my professional development. I hope my portfolio gives you a clear picture of my journey and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.</p>
