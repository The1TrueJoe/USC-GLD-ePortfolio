        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Joseph Telaak, and I’m a Computer Engineering major at the University of South Carolina. I’m on the Research Pathway as part of my Graduation with Leadership Distinction (GLD), which reflects my deep involvement in research and technical projects during my time at USC.</p>

        <p>Throughout my undergraduate journey, I’ve had the chance to work on a variety of research projects that have shaped my academic and professional development. As an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the SyReX Lab, I’ve focused on using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology for advanced sensing applications. One significant project involved developing a system to predict electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using mmWave radar, which allowed me to delve into signal processing, machine learning, and healthcare technology.</p>

        <p>Beyond my work in the SyReX Lab, I’ve participated in several other projects at USC that have broadened my skills. For example, in one course project, I was part of a team that developed a remote control car with collision detection using a Raspberry Pi and LIDAR technology. This hands-on experience was a practical application of what I’ve learned in class, and it helped me strengthen my teamwork and problem-solving abilities.</p>

        <p>Another highlight of my time at USC was presenting my work on an Arduino-based rocket flight computer at the AIAA Region II Student Conference. This project involved designing a system to monitor a model rocket’s flight parameters using GPS, IMU, and telemetry systems. Presenting at the conference was a valuable experience that emphasized the importance of clear communication in engineering.</p>

        <p>These research experiences have been both challenging and rewarding, contributing significantly to my growth as a student and researcher. Because of my passion for research, I chose the Research Pathway for my GLD. This pathway represents my commitment to hands-on learning and my desire to make meaningful contributions to the field of engineering.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, I plan to continue working on research in advanced sensing and signal processing technologies. My portfolio highlights the key insights I’ve gained throughout my time at USC, demonstrating how these experiences have shaped my professional development. I hope my portfolio provides a clear picture of my journey and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.</p>
