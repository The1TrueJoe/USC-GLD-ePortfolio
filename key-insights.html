        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at USC, I have gained valuable insights that have shaped my approach to engineering and research. Here are three key lessons I've learned from my experiences:</p>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h3>
            <p>During my time at USC, I've come to understand how important it is to draw on knowledge from different areas when tackling complex problems. This was particularly evident in my work on the mmWave ECG system. The project involved using millimeter-wave radar technology to predict ECG signals, which required a mix of skills from signal processing, biomedical engineering, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>Working on this project alone meant I had to approach the problem from multiple angles. I started with my knowledge of signal processing but quickly realized I needed to understand the physiological aspects of ECG signals to make the system effective. This led me to study biomedical concepts more deeply, which was essential for translating the radar data into meaningful health metrics. Additionally, integrating machine learning required me to adapt algorithms to work with real-world data, which added another layer of complexity.</p>
            <p>This experience taught me that solving real-world problems often requires blending insights from different disciplines. It also reinforced the importance of being open to learning new things and applying them in practical ways. This interdisciplinary approach has become a key part of how I approach engineering challenges.</p>

            <h3>Translating Theory into Practice</h3>
            <p>One of the most valuable lessons I've learned at USC is the difference between understanding something in theory and making it work in practice. This became clear during a group project in my ELCT 201 course, where we developed a remote control car with collision detection. We used a Raspberry Pi and LIDAR to create a system that could detect obstacles and stop the car automatically.</p>
            <p>While the theory behind the project was straightforward, putting it into practice was another story. We encountered issues like sensor noise and variability in environmental conditions that weren’t covered in our coursework. These challenges forced us to rethink our approach, repeatedly testing and refining the system until it worked reliably.</p>
            <p>This project showed me that theoretical knowledge is only the beginning. The real challenge lies in applying that knowledge to solve practical problems, which often involves dealing with unexpected issues. This experience has strengthened my problem-solving skills and my ability to adapt theory to real-world applications.</p>

            <h3>Leadership in Innovation</h3>
            <p>Leading a project from start to finish has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my education at USC. This was especially true for my Arduino-based rocket flight computer project, which I presented at the AIAA Region II Student Conference. The project involved designing a system to monitor a model rocket’s flight using GPS, IMU, and telemetry.</p>
            <p>As the sole developer, I handled everything from the initial design and coding to testing and troubleshooting. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that all components worked together to provide accurate data. This required careful planning and problem-solving, particularly when things didn’t go as expected during testing.</p>
            <p>Presenting my project at the conference was a valuable experience. It wasn’t just about explaining the technical details—it was about communicating the significance of my work to an audience of peers and professionals. This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication and persistence in bringing a project to completion. It also highlighted the role of leadership in driving innovation, not just through technical expertise but through the ability to see a project through from concept to final presentation.</p>
