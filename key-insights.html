        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at USC, I have gained valuable insights that have shaped my approach to engineering and research. Below are three key lessons I've learned from my experiences, each supported by specific projects that illustrate these insights in action.</p>

        <!-- Insight 1 -->
        <div id="insight-1">
            <h3>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h3>
            <p>During my time at USC, I've come to understand how crucial it is to integrate knowledge from different fields when tackling complex problems. This was especially clear in my work on the mmWave ECG system, where I was tasked with predicting ECG signals using millimeter-wave radar technology. The project required me to draw on skills from signal processing, biomedical engineering, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>While I initially approached the project with a strong focus on the technical aspects of signal processing, I quickly realized that a deep understanding of human physiology was necessary to accurately model ECG signals. This required me to dive into biomedical concepts, which were essential for translating radar data into meaningful health metrics. Furthermore, incorporating machine learning added another layer of complexity, as I had to tailor algorithms to handle the nuances of real-world data.</p>
            <p>This project reinforced the idea that effective problem-solving often requires a multidisciplinary approach. It highlighted the importance of being adaptable and willing to learn from other fields to create innovative solutions. These experiences have significantly shaped how I approach engineering challenges, emphasizing the need for a well-rounded perspective.</p>

            <h3>Translating Theory into Practice</h3>
            <p>One of the most significant lessons I've learned at USC is the importance of translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications. This became particularly evident during a group project in my ELCT 201 course, where we developed a remote control car equipped with collision detection technology. Our goal was to create a system that could detect obstacles and automatically stop the car using a Raspberry Pi and LIDAR.</p>
            <p>The project began with a solid theoretical foundation, but as we moved into the practical implementation, we encountered various challenges that required us to adapt our approach. Issues such as sensor noise and variability in environmental conditions, which weren't fully covered in our coursework, forced us to rethink our design. Through repeated testing and refinement, we were able to develop a reliable system that performed well under different conditions.</p>
            <p>This experience taught me that theoretical knowledge is only part of the equation. The ability to apply that knowledge to solve real-world problems, while adapting to unforeseen challenges, is what truly defines success in engineering. This insight has been crucial in developing my problem-solving skills and has prepared me for future projects where adaptability and practical application are key.</p>

            <h3>Leadership in Innovation</h3>
            <p>Leading a project from concept to completion has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my education at USC. This was particularly true for my Arduino-based rocket flight computer project, which I presented at the AIAA Region II Student Conference. The project involved designing a system to monitor and record a model rocket’s flight data using GPS, IMU, and telemetry systems.</p>
            <p>As the sole developer, I was responsible for every aspect of the project, from the initial design and coding to testing and troubleshooting. One of the major challenges I faced was ensuring that all the components worked together seamlessly to provide accurate data. This required careful planning, extensive testing, and iterative problem-solving when things didn’t go as planned.</p>
            <p>Presenting my work at the AIAA conference was a significant milestone. It wasn’t just about showcasing the technical aspects of the project; it was also about effectively communicating the importance and potential impact of my work to an audience of peers and professionals. This experience reinforced the value of leadership in driving innovation, not just through technical expertise but also through clear communication and the ability to see a project through to its successful conclusion.</p>
