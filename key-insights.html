        <h2>Key Insights: What I Learned</h2>
        <p>During my time at USC, I’ve gained several insights that have shaped my approach to engineering and research. These lessons come from a mix of classroom learning and hands-on experiences. Below, I share three key insights that have been particularly influential in my development.</p>

        <!-- Insight 1 -->
        <div id="insight-1">
            <h3>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Working on the mmWave ECG project showed me the importance of blending knowledge from different fields. This project required me to connect the dots between signal processing, biomedical engineering, and machine learning. At first, I focused heavily on the technical side, but I soon realized that understanding and integrating concepts from these other areas was key to making the project work. This experience taught me that effective problem-solving often requires a multidisciplinary approach. Moving forward, I’m committed to working across fields to create more well-rounded and innovative solutions.</p>

        <div id="insight-2">
            <h3>Translating Theory into Practice</h3>
            <p>When my team and I developed a remote control car with collision detection using a Raspberry Pi and LIDAR, I learned how challenging it can be to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting. This project highlighted the gap between what we learn in the classroom and what’s needed in practical situations. We encountered issues that required us to think on our feet and adapt our approach, showing me that theory is just the starting point. This experience has made me more aware of the need to balance theory with flexibility and practical problem-solving in future projects.</p>

        <!-- Insight 3 -->
        <div id="insight-3">
            <h3>Leadership in Innovation</h3>
            <p>Leading the development of an Arduino-based rocket flight computer, which I presented at the AIAA Region II Student Conference, taught me a lot about leadership. Managing the project from start to finish, I was responsible for making sure everything—from the design to the final presentation—came together smoothly. This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication and organization, and it showed me that leadership is about guiding a project to successful completion while making sure everyone involved is on the same page. These lessons in leadership are ones I plan to carry into future projects.</p>
