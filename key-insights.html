        <h2>Key Insights: What I Learned</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at USC, I’ve gained valuable insights that have transformed how I approach engineering and research. These insights are grounded in both my classroom learning and beyond-the-classroom experiences, which together have shaped my understanding and influenced my future direction. Below are three key insights I’ve developed, each explained through a combination of experiences and reflection.</p>

        <!-- Insight 1 -->
        <div id="insight-1">
            <h3>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h3>
            <p>During my work on the mmWave ECG project, I was tasked with using millimeter-wave radar technology to predict ECG signals. This project required integrating knowledge from multiple fields, including signal processing, biomedical engineering, and machine learning. Initially, I was focused on the technical aspects, but I soon realized that the success of the project depended on synthesizing these diverse areas of expertise. The experience taught me that solving complex problems often requires a multidisciplinary approach. It pushed me to collaborate across fields and appreciate the value of diverse perspectives. Moving forward, I will actively seek opportunities to work with professionals from different disciplines, as I now understand the significant impact such collaboration can have on innovation.</p>

        <!-- Insight 2 -->
        <div id="insight-2">
            <h3>Translating Theory into Practice</h3>
            <p>In a course project where my team developed a remote control car with collision detection using a Raspberry Pi and LIDAR, we faced numerous challenges that required us to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. This project highlighted the gap between theory and practice, showing me that while theoretical understanding is essential, the ability to adapt and solve real-world problems is what defines success in engineering. The experience made me appreciate the importance of hands-on application and the need to be flexible when unexpected challenges arise. This insight has shaped how I approach projects, ensuring that I balance theoretical knowledge with practical adaptability.</p>

        <!-- Insight 3 -->
        <div id="insight-3">
            <h3>Leadership in Innovation</h3>
            <p>Leading the development of an Arduino-based rocket flight computer, which I presented at the AIAA Region II Student Conference, was a significant milestone in my academic career. I was responsible for designing a system to monitor and record a model rocket’s flight data using GPS, IMU, and telemetry systems. This project required not just technical skills but also leadership, as I coordinated every aspect of the project. The experience reinforced the critical role of leadership in driving innovation, showing me that clear goals, effective communication, and team coordination are essential for success. This insight has had a lasting impact on how I approach both technical challenges and leadership opportunities, and I plan to continue developing these skills in future projects.</p>
