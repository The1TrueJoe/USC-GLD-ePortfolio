        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Leadership has been an important part of my research work at USC. Here’s a look at how I applied leadership skills during my ECG research project, from identifying challenges to implementing solutions and evaluating the results.</p>

        <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>While working on my ECG research project, which focused on using millimeter-wave radar to predict ECG signals, I encountered significant challenges in coordinating the various technical aspects. The project required expertise in signal processing, machine learning, and biomedical engineering. Managing these different components effectively was a key challenge, particularly when it came to integrating them into a cohesive system.</p>
        <p>The project was technically demanding, but the biggest obstacle was ensuring that each aspect of the work was aligned and progressing smoothly. Without a structured approach, the project risked delays and misalignment between the different technical requirements.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>To address these challenges, I decided to apply a more organized project management approach. I broke down the project into smaller tasks, each with clear objectives and timelines. This helped me focus on one aspect of the project at a time, ensuring that each part was developed and tested thoroughly before moving on.</p>
        <p>I also implemented regular check-ins with any collaborators involved in different aspects of the project, even when working solo. This helped in maintaining focus and allowed for early identification of any issues that needed to be addressed, which was crucial in keeping the project on track.</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The structured approach made a significant difference in how the project progressed. By breaking the project into smaller, manageable parts, I was able to ensure that each component—signal processing, machine learning, and biomedical data interpretation—was fully developed before integration. This step-by-step process helped avoid the chaos that often comes with trying to manage everything at once.</p>
        <p>For example, I first focused on developing and testing the signal processing algorithms before moving on to machine learning model training. This approach allowed me to troubleshoot and refine each part individually, making the final integration smoother and more efficient.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>The ECG project was completed successfully and met the technical goals I had set. The structured management approach proved effective, allowing the project to stay on track and ensuring that each component worked well together. This experience reinforced the value of strong organizational skills in research, particularly when dealing with complex, multidisciplinary projects.</p>
        <p>Overall, this project taught me that leadership in research isn’t just about managing people—it’s also about managing tasks and ensuring that technical components are developed in a coordinated and efficient manner.</p>
