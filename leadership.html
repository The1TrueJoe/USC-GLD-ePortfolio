        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Leading the remote control car project with LIDAR-based collision detection during the ELCT 201 course was a pivotal experience in developing my leadership skills. Below, I detail how I managed this fast-paced project, which spanned two weeks from brainstorming to development and final presentation.</p>

        <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>The remote control car project required the integration of various technologies, including LIDAR for obstacle detection, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and an Arduino for controlling the car's movements. As the project leader, I quickly identified that our biggest challenge would be coordinating the efforts of our team members, who were responsible for different technical components. Each aspect of the project had to come together seamlessly within a tight two-week timeline, and without strong leadership, we risked delays and potential failures during the final demonstration.</p>
        <p>The project required not only technical expertise but also effective communication and time management to ensure that all components—hardware setup, software integration, and sensor calibration—were completed on time and functioned as intended.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>To tackle these challenges, I implemented a structured project management approach. I divided the project into distinct phases: hardware setup, software development, and system integration. Each team member was assigned specific tasks with clear deadlines to keep the project moving forward. I also established regular check-ins, where we could discuss progress, troubleshoot issues, and adjust our strategy as needed.</p>
        <p>To ensure that all team members were aligned, I created a shared project timeline that detailed each phase's objectives and deadlines. This helped everyone understand their roles and the importance of timely completion to the overall success of the project.</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The structured approach allowed us to stay on track despite the tight deadline. For instance, the hardware team focused on setting up the Raspberry Pi and connecting it to the LIDAR sensor, while the software team developed the necessary code in Python and C++ to process sensor data and control the car's movements. By breaking the project into manageable tasks, we were able to tackle challenges such as sensor calibration and software bugs without derailing the entire project.</p>
        <p>One of the key challenges we encountered was the LIDAR sensor's performance in different lighting conditions, which initially caused inaccuracies in obstacle detection. Through our regular meetings, we brainstormed solutions, eventually fine-tuning the sensor's settings and adjusting our code to improve accuracy. My role as the leader was to facilitate these discussions, ensuring that all voices were heard and that we quickly implemented the best solutions.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Despite the tight timeline, we successfully completed the project, delivering a functional remote control car capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles. Our final presentation demonstrated the car’s ability to navigate around obstacles, meeting the technical requirements we set out to achieve. The structured leadership approach I applied was critical in ensuring that the project stayed on track and that all team members were coordinated and focused on our shared goals.</p>
        <p>This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication, task delegation, and adaptability in project management. It taught me that effective leadership is not just about directing tasks but also about supporting your team and helping them navigate challenges to achieve the project’s objectives.</p>
