        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>At USC, I’ve developed a strong foundation in applying my technical and research skills to real-world problems. Here, I’ll discuss how I plan to use the insights I’ve gained to lead a project aimed at improving healthcare monitoring in underserved communities.</p>

        <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
        <p>Cardiovascular disease is a major health issue, but traditional ECG systems are often cumbersome, especially in settings like rural communities or emergency situations. My goal is to develop a contactless ECG system using millimeter-wave radar technology. This system would allow for continuous monitoring without the need for physical contact, making it especially useful in areas where traditional setups are impractical.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
        <p>Based on my experience with interdisciplinary collaboration, I plan to bring together experts in biomedical engineering, wireless communication, and healthcare to develop this system. My previous projects have taught me the importance of translating theory into practice, so I will focus on creating a system that is both innovative and practical for real-world use. I’ll lead the project by setting clear goals, coordinating efforts among team members, and ensuring that the system meets the needs of healthcare providers in these communities.</p>

        <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
        <h4>Phase 1: Research and Development</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Design and build the hardware setup for the contactless ECG system.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Develop a working prototype that can accurately monitor ECG signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4-6 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 2: Testing and Iteration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Test the system with volunteers and refine it based on feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure the system is reliable and user-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-4 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 3: Deployment and Integration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Deploy the system in selected communities and train healthcare workers on its use.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Fully integrate the system into local healthcare practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2-3 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Evaluation Plan</h3>
        <p>To evaluate the success of the project, I’ll collect data on the system’s performance, focusing on accuracy and user satisfaction. Feedback from healthcare providers and patients will be essential in refining the system further. The project will be considered successful if it improves monitoring efficiency and patient comfort compared to traditional ECGs.</p>
