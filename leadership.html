        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Leading the remote control car project with LIDAR-based collision detection in my ELCT 201 course was a pivotal experience in developing my leadership skills. This classroom project, which spanned just two weeks from brainstorming to final presentation, provided a foundation that I later applied in a research setting during the AutoSense project, even though I wasn’t in a leadership role there.</p>

        <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>The ELCT 201 car project required integrating various technologies, including LIDAR for obstacle detection, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and an Arduino for controlling the car's movements. As the project leader, I quickly realized our biggest challenge would be coordinating the efforts of team members who were responsible for different technical components. With just two weeks to complete the project, effective leadership was crucial to avoiding delays and ensuring a successful final demonstration.</p>
        <p>This experience highlighted the importance of technical coordination, communication, and time management—skills that would prove invaluable when I participated in the AutoSense research project, which focused on developing sensor-based systems for health monitoring.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>To manage the ELCT 201 project, I implemented a structured approach. I divided the work into phases: hardware setup, software development, and system integration. Each team member had specific tasks with clear deadlines to keep the project on track. We also held regular check-ins to discuss progress, troubleshoot issues, and adjust our strategy as needed.</p>
        <p>These strategies directly influenced how I approached my work on the AutoSense project. Although I was not the project leader, I contributed by applying the same principles of structured task management and clear communication. Understanding the importance of these elements from my ELCT 201 experience helped me collaborate effectively with my research team.</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The structured approach in ELCT 201 allowed us to stay on track despite the tight deadline. The hardware team focused on setting up the Raspberry Pi and connecting it to the LIDAR sensor, while the software team developed the necessary code to process sensor data and control the car's movements. By breaking the project into manageable tasks, we tackled challenges like sensor calibration and software bugs without derailing the entire project.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in the AutoSense project, I worked on processing sensor data and integrating it with the larger system. The hands-on experience from ELCT 201 made it easier to troubleshoot technical issues and collaborate on solutions, ensuring that our research goals were met efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>The ELCT 201 project was a success, delivering a functional remote control car that could detect and avoid obstacles. Our final presentation demonstrated the car’s ability to navigate around obstacles, meeting the technical requirements we set out to achieve. This project reinforced the importance of clear communication, task delegation, and adaptability—skills that I carried forward into my research work.</p>
        <p>In the AutoSense project, these skills helped me contribute effectively to the team. The research involved complex data analysis and system integration, and the organizational strategies I learned in ELCT 201 were invaluable in managing these tasks. Although I wasn’t the project leader, my ability to work within a structured framework and communicate clearly with my team members was crucial to our success.</p>
