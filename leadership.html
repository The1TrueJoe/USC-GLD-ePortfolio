        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Leading the remote control car project with LIDAR-based collision detection was a critical learning experience for me. This project spanned two weeks from brainstorming to final presentation and taught me important skills in project management, which I later applied in my research work on the AutoSense project.</p>

        <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>In the car project, we needed to integrate different technologies, including LIDAR for obstacle detection, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and an Arduino for controlling the car's movements. As the leader, I realized early on that coordinating the team’s efforts would be the biggest challenge. We had a tight deadline, so it was essential to manage everyone’s tasks efficiently to avoid delays and ensure a smooth final presentation.</p>
        <p>This need for coordination and time management became even more relevant when I participated in the AutoSense research project, where I worked on developing sensor-based systems for health monitoring.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>To keep the car project on track, I broke it down into clear phases: hardware setup, software development, and system integration. Each team member had specific tasks and deadlines. We also held regular check-ins to review progress, address any issues, and make necessary adjustments.</p>
        <p>These strategies were equally valuable when I contributed to the AutoSense project. Although I wasn’t the leader, I used the same structured approach to manage my work, ensuring I could collaborate effectively with the research team and handle my responsibilities efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>Breaking the car project into manageable tasks helped us stay on track. The hardware team set up the Raspberry Pi and connected it to the LIDAR sensor, while the software team developed code to process sensor data and control the car's movements. This approach allowed us to tackle issues like sensor calibration and software bugs without derailing the entire project.</p>
        <p>In the AutoSense project, I applied similar methods to contribute to the research goals. The hands-on experience from the car project made it easier for me to troubleshoot and integrate the sensor data into the larger system.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>The car project was a success, and our final presentation demonstrated the car’s ability to detect and avoid obstacles. This project reinforced the importance of clear communication, task delegation, and adaptability—skills that I later applied in the AutoSense research project. These skills helped me work well with my team and manage complex tasks in sensor data analysis and system integration, even though I wasn’t leading the project.</p>
