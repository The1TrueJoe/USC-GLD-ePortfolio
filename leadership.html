        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at USC, I've developed a deep understanding of how to apply research and technical knowledge to address real-world problems. In this section, Iâ€™ll describe how I plan to apply these insights to lead a project that could significantly impact healthcare delivery, particularly in the context of remote and underserved communities.</p>

        <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
        <p>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in many developed countries, including the United States, where it accounts for 1 in 5 deaths. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial in managing these conditions, but traditional Electrocardiograms (ECGs) often require invasive, uncomfortable, and cumbersome setups that can be especially problematic in settings like the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or during stress testing.</p>
        <p>My initiative aims to solve this issue by developing a contactless ECG system using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology. This system would provide a safe and effective alternative to traditional ECGs, allowing continuous monitoring without the need for physical contact. The focus will be on implementing this technology in environments where traditional ECGs are not ideal, such as in remote communities, emergency vehicles, or NICUs.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
        <p>Building on the key insights I've gained from my research and projects at USC, I propose the following solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Similar to my work on the mmWave ECG system, this project will require collaboration between experts in biomedical engineering, wireless communication, and healthcare. By combining these disciplines, we can ensure that the system is both technically sound and feasible for real-world application.</li>
            <li><strong>Translating Theory into Practice:</strong> The development of this system will involve turning theoretical concepts into a practical tool that can be deployed in various healthcare settings. Drawing from my experience with hands-on projects like the remote control car with collision detection, I will focus on making the system user-friendly and reliable, even in challenging environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership in Innovation:</strong> As with my leadership in previous projects, I will take charge of this initiative by setting clear goals, coordinating the development process, and ensuring that all stakeholders are engaged. My role will include managing the project timeline, delegating tasks, and maintaining clear communication among team members and healthcare providers who will use the system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
        <p>The following plan outlines the steps to bring this project to fruition:</p>
        <h4>Phase 1: Research and Development</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Design and construct the hardware setup for the contactless ECG system, utilizing mmWave radar and ECG synchronization techniques.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Develop a prototype that can accurately measure ECG signals without physical contact.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4-6 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 2: Testing and Iteration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct tests with volunteers to validate the system's accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stress environments like NICUs or emergency vehicles.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Refine the system based on test results and feedback from healthcare professionals.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-4 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Phase 3: Deployment and Integration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Deploy the system in selected healthcare settings and provide training for healthcare providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure the system is fully operational and integrated into the daily workflow of healthcare providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2-3 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Evaluation Plan</h3>
        <p>To evaluate the success of this project, I will use the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather data on the system's performance, focusing on metrics such as detection accuracy, user satisfaction, and health outcomes in monitored patients.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Collect feedback from healthcare providers and patients to assess the usability and effectiveness of the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> The project will be deemed successful if it demonstrates a significant improvement in monitoring efficiency and patient comfort compared to traditional ECGs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This initiative, rooted in the lessons I've learned during my time at USC, has the potential to make a significant impact on healthcare delivery, particularly in underserved areas. By applying my key insights to this real-world problem, I hope to lead a project that not only advances technology but also improves patient care.</p>
