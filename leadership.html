        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Leading the remote control car project with LIDAR-based collision detection was a key learning experience for me. This project spanned two weeks from brainstorming to final presentation and gave me practical insights that I later applied in my research work with AutoSense.</p>

        <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>The remote control car project required us to combine various technologies: LIDAR for obstacle detection, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and an Arduino for controlling the car's movements. As the project leader, I quickly realized that our main challenge would be coordinating the efforts of team members responsible for different parts of the project. With just two weeks to complete everything, strong leadership was essential to keep us on track and avoid delays.</p>
        <p>These coordination and time management skills turned out to be just as important when I later worked on the AutoSense project, which focused on developing sensor-based systems for health monitoring.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>To manage the car project, I broke it down into phases: hardware setup, software development, and system integration. Each team member had specific tasks and deadlines to keep things moving. We also had regular check-ins to discuss progress, solve problems, and make any necessary adjustments.</p>
        <p>When I joined the AutoSense project, these strategies helped me contribute effectively, even though I wasn't in a leadership role. The structured approach I learned from the car project made it easier for me to collaborate with the research team and manage my part of the work.</p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The structured approach in the car project allowed us to stay on track despite the tight deadline. The hardware team focused on setting up the Raspberry Pi and connecting it to the LIDAR sensor, while the software team developed the necessary code to process sensor data and control the car's movements. Breaking the project into manageable tasks helped us handle challenges like sensor calibration and software bugs without losing momentum.</p>
        <p>In the AutoSense project, I applied the same kind of structured thinking. My experience with troubleshooting and system integration in the car project helped me contribute to the research team’s goals more effectively.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>We successfully completed the car project, delivering a remote control car that could detect and avoid obstacles. Our final presentation showed the car’s ability to navigate around obstacles, meeting the goals we had set. This project reinforced the importance of clear communication, task delegation, and staying adaptable—skills that were just as valuable in my research work with AutoSense.</p>
        <p>In AutoSense, these skills helped me work well with my team, even though I wasn’t leading the project. The ability to stay organized and communicate clearly made a big difference in how we handled the complex tasks involved in sensor data analysis and system integration.</p>
